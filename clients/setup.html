        <h2>Known Bugs</h2>
        <h3>Event Schedule freezes</h3>
        <p>
            Be patient and the page should complete loading.
            Unfortunately the code is very inefficient, but since it is workable, the problem will be addressed when I have more free time.

        <h3>Event Schedule not showing up</h3>
        <p>
            There is a bug in the event schedule that requires all the data to be loaded from the server before it tries to render the schedule.
            Unless your computer is really slow but your network is blazing, this page won't work on the first time.
            To see the schedule, open the schedule and wait a second, close the schedule tab, then open it again.
            There should be a pause for several seconds as the schedule gets drawn.
            Again, this will be addressed when I have more free time.
